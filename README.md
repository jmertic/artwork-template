# Artwork Repository Template

This template repo is designed for a project to showcase logos easily in multiple formats. Generally speaking, a given project will prepare artwork in 2 formats (PNG & SVG) and at least 3 versions (color/black/white).

# How to use this template

After creating a new repository based on this template, there are generally three things you will need to do.

## Setup the \_config.yml file

The [\_config.yml](\_config.yml) file contains the base settings for the artwork repo, including naming, color schemes, default logos, and more. The file is well commented with the different options available.

## Create folders for each logo set

Next you will create folders for each logo set. You can either create the folders in a flat structure in the root directory of the repository, or have a nested structure to group like logo sets together ( for example, projects and other logos ).

Details on how to do this are at [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md)
